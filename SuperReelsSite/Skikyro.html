    <p>"Jack" is right, as Jack Ciesniewski could be considered something of a jack of all trades. He takes a lot of initiative in projects he's involved in. Being the most musically inclined out of the group, Jack usually takes the role of lead composer. He also takes the wheel when it comes to acting, directing, and writing. Unfortunately, as of writing this, no films written or directed by Jack have made it into production, but that will soon change, as he has no lack of ideas (time, however, is a different story). Jack is also an automobile enthusiast, and takes interest in microbiology and architecture. In fact, in may just be a faster to list all of the things Jack isn't interested in. Jack's taste lie primarily in the science fiction and horror genres, with his favorite movies being John Carpenter's <i>The Thing</i> and Richard Kelly's <i>Donnie Darko.</i> Jack is currently working on a space epic called <i>22,600</i>. It's a tad out of scope as a film so expect a novel... A long one. </p>
