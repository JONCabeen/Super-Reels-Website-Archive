        <p>What can be said about Jahin Alam that hasn't been said already? We often think of Jahin as our marketing manager, he knows what a wide audience would like to see. He loves big blockbusters and romantic comedies, and prefers it when horror movies are PG-13 as apposed to R. Jahin doesn't strive to weird-out his audience, or make them overly uncomfortable, and as a result, he has the potential to be the most successful out of all of us. Jahin brought Jonathan Cabeen and Solomon Ernsr together at Alum Creek Park one evening to make <i>Day in the Park</i>, and the short was improvised in a few hours without a script.</p>
