    <p><i>Clyde and Dale Save Christmas!</i> is a buddy slacker comedy written by Joel McPeak and Will Gaskeen. When overgrown man-children brothers Clyde and Dale are told that their parents are getting a divorce, they set off on a long journey to save that year's Christmas celebration... As well as their parents marriage. This one's status as a Super Reels film is debatable, however, Ben was the director, editor, and producer, and Jonathan was involved as an actor and a boom-mic operator. With it being one of the longest and highest quality films Ben has released, it's a great addition to our selection of films, but it belongs to Joel and Will first and foremost.</p>
